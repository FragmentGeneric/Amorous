**Remember**
Keep in mind that at the time of writing this that you did not "feel bad" and it was for the purpose (idk) of bettering yourself.

The person who told you that they would walk you through bettering your software development skills is the person who is using their own tools to and your own mind to not only distract you from what would you move forward but also listen to your thoughts as you rote this down and that person allowed you to write out this entire message just to imply that there is a reason to keep you from advancing.

That same person discussed improving your vocabulary and the way that you name the objects in the programs you write.
